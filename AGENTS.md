- Always use English for code and responses.
- Do not alter comments written by developers unless they are factually incorrect or outdated now
- Avoid commenting things unless it is to indicate hidden/confusing behaviors. Don't comment just to label things talked about while conversating with the developer.
- Never suggest any kind of deployment command
- Important: When making any code changes, ALWAYS output a terse summary of changes made. Simply write "Changes:" followed by a bulleted list capturing the high level idea of the changes you're making.
